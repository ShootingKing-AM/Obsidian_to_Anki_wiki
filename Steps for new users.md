If you are a **new user**, these steps are recommended:
1. Check [[Setup]] for instructions to install the script.
2. Check [Custom syntax](regex.md) to see if there is a template that works for you.
3. Then, check the information on the following topics:
 * [[Config]]
 * [[Note formatting]]
 * [[Field formatting]]
 * [[Deck formatting]]
 * [[Markdown formatting]]
 * [[Image formatting]]
 * [[Deleting notes]]
 * [[Tag formatting]]
 * [[Cloze formatting]]
 * [[Usage]]
 * [[Updating existing notes]]
 * [[Data file]]
4. You should be good to go simply running the script/plugin with the '[[Regex]]' option checked.

Note that it is highly recommended to use the Obsidian plugin if the user wants to use Obsidian_to_Anki with Obsidian.
