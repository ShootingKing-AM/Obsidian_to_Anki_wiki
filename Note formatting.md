# Generic notes

In the markdown file, you must format your 'block' notes as follows (see [Inline notes](#inline-note-formatting) for notes on a single line):
<pre>
START
{Note Type}
{Note Fields}
Tags:
END
</pre>

As an example:

<pre>
START
Basic
This is a test.
Back: Test successful!
Tags: Testing
END
</pre>

See [[Field formatting]] and [[Tag formatting]] for more information.
