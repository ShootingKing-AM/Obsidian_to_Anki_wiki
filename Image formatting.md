# All users
## Web-hosted images

Do `![alt-text](image_url)`. You'll want to do 'copy image address' on the image, and use that for the image url.

# Python Script users
## Local images

Embedded images are supported if they are embedded using the standard markdown syntax: `![alt-text](path_to_image)`

GIFs should work too.

# Obsidian Plugin users
## Local images

Both Obsidian-style embeds and standard markdown embeds are supported!
