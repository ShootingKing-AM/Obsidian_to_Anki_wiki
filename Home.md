# Current features
* **[[Note formatting]] with custom note types** - You're not limited to the 6 built-in note types of Anki.
* **[[Updating existing notes]]** - When running the script on a file again, it'll automatically update existing notes in Anki, preserving scheduling information.
* **[[Tag formatting]]**.
* **[[Deck formatting]]** on a *per-file* basis.
* **[[Markdown formatting]]**.
* **[[Math formatting]]**.
* **[[Image formatting]]**.
* **[[Audio formatting]]**
* **[[Deleting notes]] from the file**.
* **Reading from all files in a directory automatically** - recursively too!
* **[[Inline notes]]** - Shorter syntax for typing out notes on a single line.
* **[[Cloze formatting]]** - A more compact syntax to do Cloze text.
* **[[Frozen Fields]]**
* **[[Obsidian Integration]]** - Currently, this only includes a link to the file that made the flashcard, appended to the first field of your card.
* **[[Regex]]** - Using **regular expressions**, add custom syntax to generate **notes that make sense for you.**. Note that **all custom syntax is off by default**, and must be programmed into the script via the config file - see [[Regex]] for instructions.

By default, the script adds to the current profile in Anki - you need to switch profiles in Anki to add to another profile.
