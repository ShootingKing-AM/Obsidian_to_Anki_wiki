Anywhere within the file, format the deck that you want the notes to go into as follows:

<pre>
{Target Deck Line}
{Deck name}
</pre>

Or as:

<pre>
{Target Deck Line}: {Deck name}
</pre>

For example, with the default settings:

<pre>
TARGET DECK
Mathematics
</pre>

Or:

<pre>
TARGET DECK: Mathematics
</pre>

You may place more than one target deck in the same file, but only the first instance will be read and used.
